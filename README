INSTALLATION

make
make test
make install

TESTING

This module requires the following modules for thorough testing:

    Test::More
    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

But really, only Test::More is necessary. It can also make use of
Devel::Cover if available. While the tests might not run on perl
5.005_04, the code itself appears to work correctly.

UNINSTALLATION

This is a pure-Perl module. The following one-liner should print
out the canonical path of the file:

  perl -MData::PowerSet -le 'print $INC{"Data/PowerSet.pm"}'

Just delete this file. There is also the question of the man page.
Finding that is left as an exercise to the reader.

USAGE

  use Data::PowerSet;

  my $d = Data::PowerSet->new( 3, 1, 4 );
  while (my $r = $d->next) {
    print "@$r\n";
  }

  # prints
  3 1 4
  1 4
  3 4
  4
  3 1
  1
  3

STATUS

This module is considered mature, further development is not a
high priority.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module is dedicated to Estelle Souche, who pointed out the very
elegant and obvious algorithm.
